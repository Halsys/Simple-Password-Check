#### How to use

If you cloned the repository...

```bash
  ./checkpassword foo
  # Not common password
```

If you downloaded it via zip...

```bash
  # I assume you are in the extracted zip file directory...
  ln -s ./checkpassword.py ./checkpassword # Just for convenience.
  chmod u+x ./checkpassword.py ./checkpassword # Make it "executable" in bash
  ./checkpassword foo
  # Not common password
  ./checkpassword.py football
  # Common password
```

#### Time spent

I spent about a half-an-hour working on this script. I also made a JSON file with additional time information in no particular format... because I can... it's under "TimeTable.json".
